title: "Using loop invariants for verification in Reach"
description: "This tutorial will go through using loop invariants in Reach to verify smart contracts and prove facts that your smart contracts does not lock away funds or does not spend more than it has. The following will be covered: the difference between testing and verification, what loop invariants are and how they are used to verify loops, write a skeleton program to test our Reach setup, write a simple (incorrect) loop and its invariant and see how it fails verification, correct the previous loop and see the verification succeed, see how loop invariants help us prove assertions that hold after the loop completes, discuss how to choose the right loop invariant required for verification, write a nested loop and its invariant and lastly, study a (simplified) real-world application of loops and invariants."
